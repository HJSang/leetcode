# 1150	Check If a Number Is Majority Element in a Sorted Array
# Check for Majority Element in a sorted array
# Last Updated: 06-10-2020
# Question: Write a C function to find if a given integer x appears more than n/2 times in a sorted array of n integers.
# Basically, we need to write a function say isMajority() that takes an array (arr[] ), arrayâ€™s size (n) and a number to be searched (x) as parameters and returns true if x is a majority element (present more than n/2 times).
# Examples:
# 
# Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10}, x = 3
# Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)
# 
# Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6}, x = 4
# Output: False (x doesn't appear more than n/2 times in the given array)
# 
# Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 2}, x = 1
# Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)
