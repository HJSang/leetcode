# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary
# Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to]
# reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK
# Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.
# Note:
# If there are multiple valid itineraries,  you should return the itinerary that has the smallest
# lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a
# smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"]

# All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code)
# You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

# Example 1:
# Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
# Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]

# Example 2:
# Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
# Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
# Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
# But it is larger in lexical order.
