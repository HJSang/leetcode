# 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

# Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.
# 
# Example: 
# 
# Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
# Follow up:
# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).

class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, s: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # two points
        l,total=0,0
        ans = len(nums)+1
        for i, c in enumerate(nums):
            total +=c
            while total>=s:
                ans = min(ans, i-l+1)
                total -= nums[l]
                l +=1
        return ans if ans < len(nums)+1 else 0
