# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

# Medium

# 
# Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
# 
# Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.
# 
# The order of output does not matter.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
# s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"
# 
# Output:
# [0, 6]
# 
# Explanation:
# The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
# The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
# Example 2:
# 
# Input:
# s: "abab" p: "ab"
# 
# Output:
# [0, 1, 2]
# 
# Explanation:
# The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
# The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
# The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
